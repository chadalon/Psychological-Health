					Mental health is the rational and thinking side of health. Mentally healthy people can adapt to change, develop rational strategies to solve problems, and can complete professional and personal responsibilities.<br><br>
Learned helplessness is when people who fail repeatedly develop a response of victimization. Change is always happening, so it is good to learn how to adapt and keep yourself positive. Starting out by having small victories and building up to larger ones can help with this quite a bit. By doing this, you will become used to succeeding and start developing positive habits.<br><br>
Creating strategies to solve problems rather than avoiding them is another key to good mental health. Taking the problem one step at a time is much more doable than trying to complete it all at once. Making a plan for what you are going to do makes all the difference.<br><br>
Completing responsibilities takes discipline and self-control. Mentally healthy people use healthy ways of completing things and have the ability to learn and grow intellectually.
