				<p>
					Social health includes your interactions with others in groups and individually, your ability to use social support in times of need, and your ability to adapt to social situations. Listening to people, expressing yourself, and forming healthy relationships display good social health.<br><img id="topright" src="images\people.jpg"><br>
Families have a big impact on social development. Having family support is a big factor in health and happiness. It is good to support your family and care about them in healthy ways. Healthy families help their members to develop positive ways of dealing with cognitive and social problems.<br><br>
Having a good social support system improves overall well-being. Social support can come from friends, family, babysitters, school, church, clinics, and more. Creating a safe environment for yourself will help immensely, and this includes dropping negative and abusive people in your life. Listening and caring about people who do the same for you can form healthy relationships.
