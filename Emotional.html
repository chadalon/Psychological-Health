					Emotional health is the feeling side of health. It includes the emotions love, hate, frustration, sadness, happiness, and more. People who are emotionally healthy can communicate appropriately with others, respond appropriately to upsetting events, and can manage their emotions instead of letting them overpower them.<br><br><img id="botleft" src="images\gift.jpg">
Some ways of having good emotional health are accepting who you are, doing things you’re good at, talking about your feelings, and caring for others. If you’re not accepting to yourself, it is extremely difficult to maintain positive emotional health. Working on improving yourself rather than focusing on your flaws will help promote emotional health. Having regular communication with people around you and letting them know how you feel about certain situations will keep your emotions from getting out of control. Caring for other people is another way of having good mental health. When you forget about yourself and try to make somebody else feel better, the benefits go both ways. There is always something you can do, whether it be big or small, to help a friend or somebody you know. It can be anything from giving a gift to giving a complement.
