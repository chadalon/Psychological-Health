					Stress is the body’s response to real or perceived changes and problems. Stressors are any event that causes our body to respond. Stress has three stages-the alarm stage, the resistance stage, and the exhaustion stage. In the alarm stage, the body’s stability gets interrupted. During this stage, more blood flows to the brain, salivation decreases, heart rate and blood pressure increase, the immune system is weakened, and urine production decreases. In the Resistance stage, body resources are mobilized, and it tries to combat the stressor. The final stage is the exhaustion stage. In this stage, the chemicals and hormones that contribute to the stress response are depleted, returning the body to balance. Exhaustion often comes with this stage.<br><br><img id="topright" src="images\stress.jpg">
There is both good and bad stress. Eustress is positive stress that provides opportunities for growth, and distress can have negative effects on health. Prolonged stress response leads to allostatic load, which can lead to a compromised immune system and constant exhaustion. Prolonged stress can lead to physical problems, such as cardiovascular disease, weight gain, hair loss, diabetes, digestive problems, and more. It can impair short term memory, and can lead to depression and anxiety.<br><br>
In order to manage stress, there are many things you can do. It is good to assess your stressors and evaluate them, and then come up with a plan that prepares you for specific stressors in advance. Exercise, meditation, social interaction, breathing exercises, and cognitive restructuring are a few things you can to to counter stress.
